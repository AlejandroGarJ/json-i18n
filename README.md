    "en": "en",
    "es": ""
  },

npm run add-language
```
This will show a list of the available languages (133). Next you will have to write the language prefix (it is shown in the language list).


## Note üìù

By default, `json-i18n-gt` stores translations in a JSON file (`translations.json`) located within the `node_modules/json-i18n-gt/assets` directory. Since `node_modules` is typically ignored by Git via `.gitignore`, it's important to include the translations file in version control manually.

### Adding translations.json to .gitignore

To ensure that `translations.json` is included in version control, add the following line to your project's `.gitignore` file:

```plaintext
!node_modules/json-i18n-gt/assets/translations.json
```
This problem will be solved in future updates.
